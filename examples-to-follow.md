# Examples to Follow

This section provides real-life examples of organizations that excel in handling names respectfully
and inclusively. By showcasing positive examples, the reader can gain inspiration and practical insights
into implementing best practices in their own environment.

## US Government

> “People have a wide variety of names in various formats. It can be confusing and alienating for them
> to enter their name if it doesn't conform to the form fields provided, or if the form fields don't
> support the characters, length, or language they require.”

— [Name | U.S. Web Design System (USWDS)][1]

## UK Government

> “Not everyone's name fits the first-name, last-name format.”

— [Names – GOV.UK Design System][2]



## Counterexamples

Sadly, the Australian Government [does not yet have a similar standard][3].
