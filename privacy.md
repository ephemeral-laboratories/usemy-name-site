Thank you for visiting Use My Name!
Your privacy is important to us, and we want to be transparent about how we handle your information.

## Information We Collect

Forms to gather stories or similar from users ask the user to enter their name and location.

The rest of the website is served from static pages, which themselves are unable to
gather, store, or process any data related to your usage of the site.

## Use of Information

Names and locations gathered from users are used for the sole purpose of crediting the user for who
wrote a story, when that story is displayed on the site. We believe it is important to make it clear
when some site content was not written by the site's usual author(s), and to give proper credit to
the true author.

## Third-party Access

We do not provide any third parties with access to your information, other than what they can see for
themselves by viewing the website.

## Use of Third-party Services

### GitHub Pages

This website is hosted on GitHub Pages.

[According to GitHub:][1]

> When a GitHub Pages site is visited, the visitor's IP address is logged and stored for security
> purposes, regardless of whether the visitor has signed in to GitHub or not. For more information
> about GitHub's security practices, see [GitHub Privacy Statement][2].

### Google Analytics

This website uses Google Analytics to gather statistics about site visitors.

[According to Google:][3]

> For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services such as AdSense,
> including analytics tools such as Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube,
> your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL
> of the page that youâ€™re visiting and your IP address. We may also [set cookies on your browser][4]
> or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share
> information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.

We will not share any additional personally-identifying information with the analytics
service, as we are only interested in overall statistics, such as number of unique
visitors per country.

Any changes to this privacy policy will be posted on this page.
