# Principle: Make name entry a single field

Do not separate the text fields for first and last name.

There are people whose “last” name comes first and whose “first” name(s) come last.
There are people with no first name; there are people with no last name.

The correct UI for entering a name is a single text field.

A common excuse heard for splitting the name field is that you want to send out email
announcements where you address the person like, "Dear John". A strategy for dealing with
this is described [in another section](do-not-split-names).
