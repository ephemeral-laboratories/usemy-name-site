title: "Principle: Allow the user to update their own name"

If your system lets a person enter a name, it should also let them change it, as frequently as they want.

Conventionally, "create" and "edit" forms share the logic for their fields, so this should come for free.
If your system _doesn't_ allow editing the name, it's usually fair to assume that someone did that on purpose. 
So show that person this page as well.
