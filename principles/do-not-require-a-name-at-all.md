# Principle: Do not force a user to enter a name at all

In many cases, it’s not OK to assume that someone even has a name, so allowing the entire field
to be blank is still recommended.

> - Fallacy 32: People’s names are assigned at birth.
> - Fallacy 33: OK, maybe not at birth, but at least pretty close to birth.
> - Fallacy 34: Alright, alright, within a year or so of birth.
> - Fallacy 35: Five years?
> - Fallacy 36: You’re kidding me, right?
> - Fallacy 40: People have names.

An extension of this principle is that, if your application _doesn't really need the user's name_,
then you should avoid dealing with names entirely.
