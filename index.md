## About this site

**Names are not just words – they are integral to individual identity.**

Using people's names correctly fosters inclusivity and respect.

In many societies, names play a crucial role in personal identity, as they are often the primary
means by which individuals are recognized and addressed within their communities.

Names can hold deep cultural, familial, and personal meanings, and they are often a source of pride
and connection to one's heritage.

Using a person's name incorrectly can, at best, be a social faux pas and, at worst, risk insulting the person.

Explore our resources and join us in our mission to honor and celebrate all names,
starting with the simple yet profound act of using them correctly.

"Use My Name!" – Because every name deserves to be heard, honored, and remembered.
